==============================
This code's main purpose is to calculate transit windows, plot the visibility of these windows for given observatory and rank their quality. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate a transmission spectrum for given transit, and it will be soon possible to automatically upload the transit window observation into ESO p2 OB.
